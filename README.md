Code will be uploaded soon! (around August '18)

Update: Uploading will be delayed, due to a patent and the corresponding code license. We hope this resolves fast. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Update 2: The uploading of the code for public delays a bit more. Nevertheless, if you would like to gain access write me an email with the purpose of usage and I will share the code with you: bjoern.haefner@tum.de
