% INPUT:
%         I           is the rgb (or grayscale) input image of size m1xn1xd
%         z0          is the low-resolution depth map of size m2xn2x1
%         mask        is the mask describing the valid pixels in I of size
%                     m1xn1x1
%         K           is the 3x3 intrinsic camera matrix of I.
%                     Note that it is assumed that the camera matrix of z0

%                     size(z0,1)/size(I,1) 1]) * K; if this is not the case

%                     -mu should be within [1e-2, 1] and is the depth prior
%                      weight

%                     -lambda should be in [0.1, 10] and is the weight for
%                      the piecewise constant albedo prior

%         options     is a struct with fields consisting of all options of the code and different
%                     algorithms used in here.
